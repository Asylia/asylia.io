      "title": "QUICK OVERVIEW (plain English)",
      "p1": "What is multi-signature and why do you need it?",
      "p2": "Multi-signature (multi-sig) is a proven security mechanism that distributes control over bitcoins among multiple independent keys. A transaction only executes when authorised by at least M of N keys (M-of-N scheme).",
      "point1": "No single key holds enough power. Neither an attacker nor a negligent user can move funds alone.",
      "point2": "Key loss ≠ bitcoin loss. You only need M functioning keys.",
      "point3": "Flexibility of the model. You can include hardware wallets, family, a lawyer or the Asylia vault in the signing process.",
      "point4": "Customisable permissions. Define how many keys and which combination is required—2-of-3, 3-of-5, 5-of-7…",
      "q1": "Multi-sig in one sentence:",
      "q2": "Unlocking a bitcoin wallet requires more keys than any single party possesses alone.",
      "table": {
        "p1": {
          "title": "Private key / seed:",
          "p1": "The secret code that generates and secures your wallet.",
          "p2": "Never share it and store it offline (paper, safe, vault)."
        },
        "p2": {
          "title": "Multi-signature (multi-sig)",
          "p1": "An M-of-N rule is set. E.g., 2-of-3 signatures → any two of three keys are required to spend.",
          "p2": "Losing one key doesn’t cost you bitcoins; an attacker with a single key can’t spend them."
        },
        "p3": {
          "title": "Asylia as co-signer",
          "p1": "The platform holds only a backup key and never the majority.",
          "p2": "Without your signature, funds won’t move, but in a crisis we help finalise the transaction."
        }
      },
      "visual": {
        "title": "Visual representation of multi-sig",
        "p": "For clarity, we’ve prepared a visual of a multi-sig wallet. Imagine our BTC wallet as a chest (with treasure/bitcoins). There are multiple ways to open it, and even through one opening you can access all contents.",
        "b1": "Traditional secure wallets as most people know them.",
        "b2": "<b>Multi-signature</b> <span class=\"font-light\">security. Requires</span> <b>2 keys</b> (of 2) to open.",

    "wp1": {
      "title": "1. Introduction: Why a fortress for Bitcoin?",
      "p1": "Phishing, malware, coercion, regulatory pressure and, above all, human error threaten sovereignty over private keys. Multi-signature has historically shown that distributing power among independent parties eliminates a single point of failure and handles unforeseen scenarios (lost key or passphrase, kidnapping, extortion, death, inheritance). Asylia draws inspiration from medieval fortresses—sturdy walls, clear rules and minimal blind trust."

    "wp2": {
      "title": "2. Why Asylia.io?",
      "p1": "Etymology: Asylia (Greek ἄσυλος) = “sanctuary beyond reach”. Symbolises a place immune to unauthorised intervention. The .io domain alludes to input/output and emphasises reliable, continuous access to your bitcoins."
