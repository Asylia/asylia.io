      "p1": "What is multisignature and why do you need it?",
      "p2": "Multisignature (multi-signature, or multisig) is a proven security mechanism that distributes control over bitcoins among multiple independent keys. A transaction only executes when at least M out of N keys authorize it (M-of-N scheme).",
      "point1": "No single key holds too much power—neither an attacker nor a negligent user can spend funds alone.",
      "point2": "Key loss ≠ bitcoin loss. As long as M keys remain accessible, you retain control.",
      "point3": "Model flexibility. Involve hardware wallets, family, legal counsel, or Asylia’s vault.",
      "point4": "Custom permissions. Define how many and which combination of keys is required—2-of-3, 3-of-5, 5-of-7…",
      "q1": "Multisig in one sentence:",
      "q2": "Unlocking a Bitcoin wallet requires more keys than any single party holds independently.",

          "title": "Private key / seed:",
          "p1": "The secret code that generates and manages your wallet.",

        },
        "p2": {
          "title": "Multisignature (multisig)",
          "p1": "Sets an M-of-N rule. E.g., 2-of-3 signatures means any two out of three keys can spend.",
          "p2": "Losing one key doesn’t cost you your bitcoins; one key alone can’t spend."
        },
        "p3": {
          "title": "Asylia as co-signer",
          "p1": "By using the wallet backup type, the wallet config file becomes another key in the M-of-N scheme.",
          "p2": "Funds remain under your control even if you lose Key 1 or Key 2, provided you have the config file. It acts as a software backup key for your hardware keys."

      "p1": "Phishing, malware, coercion, regulatory pressure, and human error threaten private key sovereignty. Historically, multisig has shown that distributing authority among independent parties removes a single point of failure and handles unexpected scenarios (key loss, kidnapping, extortion, death, inheritance). Asylia draws inspiration from medieval fortresses—strong walls, clear rules, and minimal blind trust."
